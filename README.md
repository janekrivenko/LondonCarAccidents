---------------------------------
## Business understanding
The idea of this project is to check possible reasons why there is high rate of accidents in the capital:
- high population density;
- heavy traffic flow during rush hour;
- wide variety of vehicles on the roads.
The main goals is reducing the number of accidents and deaths on the roads of London.

All data that will be used in this project is taken from the open source https://data.gov.uk and provided by government departments and agencies, public bodies and local authorities.

For achieving this goal will be:
- carried out clustering of traffic accidents in the regions of London.
- identified patterns in vehicle accidents scenarios.
- predicted changes in the dynamics of accidents after the installation of CCTV cameras.
- found associations between CCTV cameras locations and level of accidents on the road.

---------------------------------
## Data understanding
Types of data necessary to achieve the data mining goals: data about car accidents, which contains such fields:
- driver?s condition: health of driver, alcohol in blood, attention, sex and age, vehicle manoeuvre;
- vehicle characteristics: car model, car age, airbags, serviceability of the machine, insurance;
- road condition: type of road, junction details and controls, road surface is wet or dry due to the weather, visibility on the road (lightning, weather), road signs and video recorders, police control;

All data is in files are the .csv format. After obtaining all data, we got more than 30 files - 22644 cases of accidents and 33 features for each one during 2010-2016. 

---------------------------------
## Planning
Work on the project has started on December 4th 2017 and will be finished on January 7th 2018.

1. Completing homework 11.
2. Working with found data - filtering and cleaning up datasets. Searching for extra datasets.
3. Write scripts for descriptive statistics.
4. Calculate and identify frequent patterns of car accidents.
5. Finding in the datasets association rules of CCTV cameras locations and level of accidents on the road.
6. Providing clusterization of the data. 
7. Produce visualization - create graphic plots of the achieved data mining goals.
8. Analysing received results - if they match to described in task one business and data mining goals. Creating report of completed work.
9. Improvement received results. Re-analysis with improved data.
10. Creating poster for poster session.
